# Athos-API
Athos-API is a lightweight PHP library to set up a basic API.

## Installation
You can download the source code directly, or install using composer:

`composer require mobles/athos-api`

## Setup
The `samples` directory contains a basic setup for your api, including a demo controller `sample`. Copy these files and directory to the root of your web app and you should be good to go!

Additionally, `sample_database.sql` contains a sample database structure as used for authentication and sessions.

Once you've set up your api, you can remove the `samples` directory.
